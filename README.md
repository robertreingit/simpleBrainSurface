# simpleBrainSurface
A collection of MATLAB functions to render a brain surface in MNI-coordinates.

## Aim
Main intended usage is for presentation of functional near-infrared spectroscopy data to show the
location of the source and detector optodes and the measurement channel positions and if desired the resulting activation signal including a simple layout generator.

## Motivation
I couldn't find anything that suited me as most render functions out there are somewhat to heavy for what I need. I put this project on Github in case anybody else is looking for something similar.
