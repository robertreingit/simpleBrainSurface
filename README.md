# simpleBrainSurface
A collection of a few functions to render a brain surface in MNI-coordinates in MATLAB.
Main usage is for presentation of functional near-infrared spectroscopy data to show the
location of the source and detector optodes and the measurement channel positions.
I couldn't find anything that suited my needs therefore I put it on Github in case anybody
else is looking for something similar.
